description: At Waylay, I migrated the non-performant InfluxDB database to KairosDB after investigating time-series databases. I performed performance analysis, researched production viability and advised and implemented a migration strategy. The migration happened live, with no customer impact. I wrote a [Scala KairosDB interface](//github.com/waylayio/kairosdb-scala) that we later open sourced.
